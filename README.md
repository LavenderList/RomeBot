# RomeBot
Bot By: Rainverm38

Get Started By Typing !help

RomeBot is a very basic chat bot, if you want to call it that, I created it to bring some more fun to my Discord Server, and well, who doesn't need the Glory of Rome in everything they do?

Now including 25% more glory in the same package! Nowhere else can you find so much glory packed into such a small package. Only 10.5 kilobytes! 

Remember, Roma Invicta and Carthago Delanda Est!

Currently, I have no plans to actively work on this, though, if I see any need for new features I will add them.

Written in Python using version 3.6.x using Discord.py

To host this bot you must have discord.py, asyncio, and datetime installed. Alternatively, you can invite it to your Discord server using this link: http://bit.ly/2Ek7Z72
