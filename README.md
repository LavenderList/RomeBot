# RomeBot by Sidpatchy
This branch will contain a nearly complete rewrite of RomeBot. I have learned a lot since I started out with RomeBot and it could be made more organized than it currently is. 

Libraries are likely to remain the same, however, I will be using sLOUT (Sidpatchy's Library of Useful Things) to compliment RomeBot v2

Another key thing that I need to do with this version, mainly for readablity and future use, is to comment on the code. Right now I can *usually* figure out what is happening but others may not have the same luck.
